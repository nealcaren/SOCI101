![Gender Symbols](../images/REALWORLD7_FIG09_CO.jpg)
This assignment is an exercise in applying methods for measuring gender bias in popular culture. You will be required to watch and analyze episodes from three different television programs. The assignment will help you to think about gender inequality and measuring culture.

## Description

- Watch [Anita Sarkeesian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF6sAAMb4s) discuss the Bechdel Test.
- Read Walt Hickey, Ella Koeze, Rachael Dottle and Gus Wezerek&#39;s &quot;[The next Bechdel Test](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/).&quot;
- Pick three different television programs. You will use the Bechdel test **and one other test discussed in the Hickey et al. article** to analyze one episode from each of your three programs. Before you watch, make a guess about whether or not each episode will pass each of the tests. Then, watch and analyze each episode of the three different television programs.  While watching, take notes on the measures associated with your two tests and anything else meaningful you observe related to the sociological study of gender.

## Requirements

- Write a brief research report (of at least 250 words) that discusses your research and what you found. The report should include:
  - an introduction
  - a description of your data and methods of analysis.
  - a description of what you found by analyzing the three episodes.
  - An evaluation of what you learned about the media you studied. Did the findings surprise you?
- An evaluation of the methods you employed. Based on your research, how would you revise the method?

## Grading

- Grading is High Pass (100); Pass (87) and Fail (0). Students who do not satisfactorily complete the exercise (i.e, Fail) will be allowed to revise and resubmit their application for a Pass within one week.
- To be eligible for a High Pass, you must go substantially beyond the assignment requirements _both in terms of research and analysis_. To qualify for a High Pass, you must include a section at the front of your paper called &quot;High Pass&quot; with at least 50 words detailing how you exceeded the requirements.
