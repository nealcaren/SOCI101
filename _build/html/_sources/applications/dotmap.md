As we discussed intthis lesson, racial and ethnic segregation is an important aspect of the American landscape. In this exercise, you will examine different patterns of segregation found in metropolitan areas.

## Description

Visit the [Racial Dot Map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/). Click &quot;Add Map Labels&quot; in the upper left corner unless you are freakily good with geography.

Your research report should respond to the following issues:

- On the racial dot map, visit Cleveland, Raleigh, Richmond, and Birmingham. For each city, how would you describe the level of Black-White segregation? Which of the four cities would rank the most segregated? The least?
- On the racial dot map, visit Albuquerque, NM and Oxnard, CA. How would you rank the level of Latino-non Latino segregation? How do Latino-White segregation compare to the Black-White segregation you explored in the four above cities?
- Finally, explore more fully one zone from one of these six cities. Your focus could either be the border between two racially different neighborhoods or some sort of surprising racial/ethnic concentration. Go over to Google Maps and locate the place. Use Street View to help get a sense of the neighborhood. Describe what you researched and what you found. Where appropriate, use pictures in your report.

## Requirements

- Your research report should be at least 250 words long.
- No late assignments will be accepted.

## Grading

- Grading is High Pass (100); Pass (87) and Fail (0). Students who do not satisfactorily complete the exercise (i.e, Fail) will be allowed to revise and resubmit their application for a Pass within one week.
- To be eligible for a High Pass, you must go substantially beyond the assignment requirements _both in terms of research and analysis_. To qualify for a High Pass, you must include a section at the front of your paper called &quot;High Pass&quot; with at least 50 words detailing how you exceeded the requirements.
