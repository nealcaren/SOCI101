This exercise is an opportunity to practice a particular sociological research method. It will provide an opportunity for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of this method, think seriously about research ethics as well as research design. and other sociological research methods.

## Description

- Read the Yale Daily News article, &quot;[DKE internal review finds no hostile culture](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/03/08/dke-internal-review-finds-no-hostile-culture/)&quot; and the [study report](http://ydn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20180219171837.pdf).
- Write a research proposal that evaluates the Yale DKE study and proposes an additional research project.
- As an additional resource, take a look at the &quot;[Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20Files/Climate%20Survey/Survey%20Instrument.pdf)&quot; survey. This has some ideas for questions. If you are doing a survey, feel free to re-use their questions (although be sure to note this in your assignment).

## Requirements

- In addition to your one paragraph evaluation, your project proposal (of at least 300 words) needs to address the following questions:
  - Is this a qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods study?
  - What are the important variables in this study? If possible and appropriate identify the dependent/independent variables.
  - How are you going to operationalize these variables?
  - If you are doing a deductive study, what is the hypothesis?
  - What population will you be studying? Will it be a census or a sample of this population? Please describe.
  - What type of research method will you use?
  - Describe your research &quot;instrument.&quot; This means you need to answer the appropriate question for your method: What are some of your survey questions? What are some of your interview questions? How would you describe the experiment you are going to conduct? Where/when/how will you perform your observations? What content will you analyze?
  - Be sure to address the three elements that sociologists take into account when performing ethical research.
  - What are the limitations of this study?
- No late assignments will be accepted.

## Grading

- Grading is High Pass (100); Pass (87) and Fail (0). Students who do not satisfactorily complete the exercise (i.e, Fail) will be allowed to revise and resubmit their application for a Pass within one week.
- To be eligible for a High Pass, you must go substantially beyond the assignment requirements _both in terms of research and analysis_. To qualify for a High Pass, you must include a section at the front of your paper called &quot;High Pass&quot; with at least 50 words detailing how you exceeded the requirements.
