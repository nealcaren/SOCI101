# Groups

This lesson explores some of the different ways we organize our lives in groups. Here you will gain some of the analytic tools you can use to understand the specific groups we’ll be investigating later in the semester. Concepts such as peer pressure, teamwork, bureaucratization, and anomie can be fruitfully applied to analyses of families, work and volunteer organizations, political groups, and religious communities. Consider this lesson an introduction to group dynamics in general—a springboard from which to begin our sociological analysis of particular types of groups. During the week, think about the groups you belong to and how they affect your values and behavior.

## Learning Objectives

```{admonition} By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Describe how sociologists define groups, organizations and networks.
* Distinguish between theoretical perspectives on groups.
* Analyze how personal identity is related to groups.
```

## Discuss: Holy Hell


![](../images/holy_hell.jpg)
> Just out of college, a young filmmaker joins a loving, secretive, and spiritual community led by a charismatic teacher in 1980s West Hollywood. Twenty years later, the group is shockingly torn apart. Told through over two decades of the filmmaker’s archival materials, this is their story. [Official description](http://www.holyhellthedocumentary.com/new-page-1)



We will use the documentary film [Holy Hell](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097438) as an opportunity to identify and evaluate concepts related to the sociology of groups.  We will watch it together during class.    
* Be sure to have [the movie](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097438) ready to go at the start of class.
* Login to the course Slack by 9:45am and say hi to your group!


Before Thursday, start thinking about what concepts are likely to be most relevant.
