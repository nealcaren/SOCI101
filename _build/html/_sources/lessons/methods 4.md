## Data (asynchronous):
### Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools

![Image from film](https://pushoutfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pushout-poster.jpg)

> Inspired by the groundbreaking book of the same name by Monique W. Morris, Ed.D, PUSHOUT: THE CRIMINALIZATION OF BLACK GIRLS IN SCHOOLS, takes a deep dive into the lives of Black girls and the practices, cultural beliefs and policies that disrupts one of the most important factors in their lives - education. Alarmingly, African American girls are the fastest-growing population in the juvenile justice system and the only group of girls to disproportionately experience criminalization at every education level.

>  The film underscores the challenges Black girls face with insights from multiple experts across the country who have worked extensively in the fields of social and criminal justice, gender equality and educational equity, giving context to the crisis and providing a roadmap for how our educational system and those who interact with Black girls can provide a positive rather than punitive response to behaviors that are often misunderstood or misrepresented. [Official description](https://unc.kanopy.com/video/pushout-criminalization-black-girls-school-1)


We will use the documentary film [Pushout](https://unc.kanopy.com/video/pushout-criminalization-black-girls-school-1) as an opportunity to bring together many of the course concepts to date.   Class will be asynchronous, so you should watch the film on your own and complete the reflection assignment.
