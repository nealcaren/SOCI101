# Assignment Types
There are several different types of assignments in the course: {ref}`applications`, {ref}`case-studies`, {ref}`InQuizitive`, {ref}`film-responses` and {ref}`exams`.


(applications)=
## Applications   
**(20% of course grade)**  
You will have eight opportunities to complete short research and writing assignments that employ concepts from the course to the outside world. You might shop at supermarket, watch a television show, or analyze housing data. For each Application, you will theories and concept from the course to develop expectations about what you'll find. After collecting the data, you will write up your study in a short research report. You will have eight opportunities to complete these, and your highest five grades will count.

(case-studies)=
## Case Studies    
**(15% of course grade)**  
Understanding how social science research is used to test theories is a unique skill you will develop in the course. Six times during the semester you will be asked to read a passage and answer a series of questions about how the study was conducted, what was found, and how it is linked to the larger body of sociological literature. These are conducted out of class on Sakai  Your top five grades count.

(InQuizitive)=
## InQuizitive      
**(15% of course grade)**  
Each non-exam week you are assigned a chapter from the textbook. To help you focus your reading on the central concepts and provide a quick check on your capacity to identify and use the new concepts, you are required to complete a weekly InQuizitive reading test. These quizzes are untimed and you can keep answering questions until you earn a perfect score.

If you have never used InQuizitive before, I highly recommend that you complete the [How To Use InQuizitive](https://ncia.wwnorton.com/111835) assignment at the beginning of the semester.

(film-responses)=
## Film Responses   
**(15% of course grade)**  
For each film that we watch in class, you are expected to participate in course discussions actively in your Slack channel. You are also responsible for writing a brief note (submitted on Sakai) where you make connections between the film and related course concepts. If you were unable to participate in the film discussion during class, you should also submit the notes that you took while watching the film.

(exams)=
## Exams  
**(45% of course grade)**  
The course has three exams: two during the semester and a final. Exams are multiple-choice and administered through Sakai. Exams during the semester are taken Thursday during class time. Those with registered accommodations will be provided additional times. The final exam will be cumulative.

## Assignment Opportunities
For {ref}`applications`, {ref}`case-studies`, {ref}`InQuizitive`, and {ref}`film-responses`, you can drop some of your lowest grades. For example, there are eight {ref}`applications` available, but only your five highest grades count. Historically, students who are happy with their grade in an assignment area tend to skip some near the end of the semester. Unlike the other assignments, no {ref}`exams` scores are dropped.
