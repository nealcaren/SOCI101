# Deviance

This lesson explores some of the different ways we organize our lives in groups. Here you will gain some of the analytic tools you can use to understand the specific groups we’ll be investigating later in the semester. Concepts such as peer pressure, teamwork, bureaucratization, and anomie can be fruitfully applied to analyses of families, work and volunteer organizations, political groups, and religious communities. Consider this lesson an introduction to group dynamics in general—a springboard from which to begin our sociological analysis of particular types of groups. During the week, think about the groups you belong to and how they affect your values and behavior. 

## Learning Objectives
