# Deviance

This lesson introduces the sociology of deviance and crime. In sociology, deviance isn't an insult.  Deviance means being non-normative: different Sociologists pay particular attention to the socially constructed nature of deviance and conformity, emphasizing how definitions of deviance vary across cultures, history, and situations.  This week, we will examine how the different theoretical perspectives approach deviance. Within sociology, crime is a particular type of deviance: It is the violation of a norm that has been codified into law, for which you could be arrested and imprisoned.  A sociological view of crime includes analyzing patterns through the lens of different demographic groups' power in society yields an interpretation of the data that differs from the mainstream understanding. The case study asks you to interpret findings from a study that looks at the relationship between imprisonment and being re-arrested.
