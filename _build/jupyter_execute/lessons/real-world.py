Before Thursday:
* What are some of your memories, feelings, or other associations with food?
* Why are eating habits so hard to break? Do you think it’s possible to be addicted to a specific food or to food in general?
* Is eating just a matter of personal behavior and preference? When do eating habits—or the effects of eating habits and food choices—step over into the public realm?
