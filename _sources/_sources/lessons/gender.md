# Gender

This lesson focuses on the processes involved in constructing the meanings of genders and sexualities and the real consequences of gender and sexual inequality.  Gender and sexuality are often portrayed as part of our biological inheritance, unchanging, and unchangeable. Sociologists see sex, gender, sexual orientation, and trans identities are status categories that structure social inequality and shape individual identities. We all experience their overlap in our everyday lives. A sociological perspective allows us to see the cultural and environmental influences on what may be considered biologically based identities and lets us identify and critique the stratification systems that have resulted from these influences.

![Image from film](https://6ydqa15l8v-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/KnockDowntheHouse_Cover_RGB300_900px-1.gif)

> Knock Down the House is the story of four working-class women who embraced the challenge of running for Congressional office in the 2018 midterm elections. They are four of the record numbers who organized grassroots campaigns, rejected corporate PAC money and challenged the notion that everyday people cannot run successful campaigns against sitting incumbents. Collectively these candidates herald a cultural and political shift to transform the process of running and electing our representatives. Such changes do not occur in a vacuum, nor are they about a singular issue. Rather they are about changing the attitudes, behaviors, terms, and outcomes of existing and entrenched norms and building to- wards a more inclusive and representative government.  [Official description](https://knockdownthehouse.com)


We will use the documentary film [Knock Down the House](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81080637) as an opportunity to explore the sociology of gender.  We will watch it together during class.
* Be sure to have [the movie](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81080637) ready to go at the start of class. It is available on Netflix.
* We will start the movie at 9:50am promptly!
