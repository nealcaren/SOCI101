Bechdel Test
============

This assignment is an exercise in applying methods for measuring gender
bias in popular culture. You will be required to watch and analyze
episodes from different television programs. The assignment will help
you to think about gender inequality and measuring culture.

Outline
-----

-   Watch [[Anita Sarkeesian]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF6sAAMb4s) discuss the Bechdel Test.

-   Read Walt Hickey, Ella Koeze, Rachael Dottle and Gus Wezerek's "[[The next Bechdel Test]{.ul}](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/).

-   Pick multiple television shows to watch. Before you watch them, make a guess about whether each will pass the Bechdel test.

-   Watch and analyze an episode from each of the television programs. While watching, take notes on anything else meaningful you observe related to the sociological study of gender.

-   Write up your findings in a brief research report.
