Bechdel Test
============

This assignment is an exercise in applying methods for measuring gender
bias in popular culture. You will be required to watch and analyze
episodes from different television programs. The assignment will help
you to think about gender inequality and measuring culture.

Outline
-----

-   Watch [[Anita Sarkeesian]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF6sAAMb4s) discuss the Bechdel Test.

-   Read Walt Hickey, Ella Koeze, Rachael Dottle and Gus Wezerek's "[[The next Bechdel Test]{.ul}](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/).

-   Pick multiple television shows to watch. Before you watch them, make a guess about whether each will pass the Bechdel test.

-   Watch and analyze an episode from each of the television programs. While watching, take notes on anything else meaningful you observe related to the sociological study of gender.

-   Write up your findings in a brief research report.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Argument</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>appDir</td>
<td>The top level directory that contains your app. If this option is used then
it assumed your scripts are in</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>baseUrl</td>
<td>By default, all modules are located relative to this path. If baseUrl is not
explicitly set, then all modules are loaded relative to the directory that holds
the build file. If appDir is set, then baseUrl should be specified as relative
to the appDir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dir</td>
<td>The directory path to save the output. If not specified, then the path will
default to be a directory called "build" as a sibling to the build file. All
relative paths are relative to the build file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>modules</td>
<td>List the modules that will be optimized. All their immediate and deep
dependencies will be included in the module's file when the build is done. If
that module or any of its dependencies includes i18n bundles, only the root
bundles will be included unless the locale: section is set above.</td>
