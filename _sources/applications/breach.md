# Breaching


Social interaction represents one of the key building blocks of society. Despite being unscripted, these interactions have strict unwritten rules. Breaking those rules, or being deviant, is a critical way of discovering what the norms are and what are the range of reactions to norm violations.

## Description

You will conduct an exercise that violates social norms and write a short paper about the experience. This exercise may be performed alone or in a group (of your choice) of four or fewer participants. The norm violation can not include illegal activities or those that might risk someone's safety, health or well-being. In our current pandemic world, I would strongly encourage you to conduct your breach on social media, such as something defies our new norms of online courses, such as brushing your teeth during Zoom class. If conducting your experiment as a group, each group member will perform the breach once. When not performing the breach, the other group members should observe the interaction and write an observation log documenting people's reaction to the breach.

Write a brief research report that discusses your research and what you found. The report should include:

- A description of the norm you violated. (Remember, you cannot break a law).
- A description of the violation.
- A description of the most general way people responded as the violation was enacted.
- A description of how you felt enacting the norm violation.
- An analytic discussion of the sociological significance of the breach.
- Video or photographic proof that the breach occurred. Ideally, this would be a link to a video of the breach. If you are doing this solo, a photo of the situation pre or post breach is sufficient. If you have trouble submitting the video/picture, you can text it to me (919-381-7638) along with your name. As part of your assignment, put "I texted the video to Professor Caren from my phone, 919-xxx-xxxx."

## Requirements

- No late assignments will be accepted.
- You may conduct your breach as part of a group, but each person must individually write and submit a research report.
- Your research report should be at least 250 words long.

## Grading

- Grading is High Pass (100); Pass (87) and Fail (0). Students who do not satisfactorily complete the exercise (i.e, Fail) will be allowed to revise and resubmit their application for a Pass within one week.
- To be eligible for a High Pass, you must go substantially beyond the assignment requirements _both in terms of research and analysis_. To qualify for a High Pass, you must include a section at the front of your paper called **High Pass** with at least 50 words detailing how you exceeded the requirements.
