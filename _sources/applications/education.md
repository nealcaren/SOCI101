Education
============

Sociologists are interested in studying the relationship between race, income and educational performance. In this exercise, you will examine that relationship and observe different patterns of student achievement.


To Do
-----

* Go to the New York Timesâ€™ interactive site [Money, Race, and Success: How Your School District Compares](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html?mcubz=3).
* Start with the first graph, which gives student achievement and family income data for every school district in the country. What do you notice about the overall patterns? Are there any exceptions?
* Find and record data on average grade level, median income, and race/ethnicity for the following districts: City of Chicago, Evanston CCSD, and Kenilworth (all in Illinois).
* Look at the second graph, which documents differences in achievement between White, Black, and Latino students. What is it showing you? In particular, what patterns do you observe around race, class, and achievement? What do you think could be responsible for these patterns? What diversity within groups do you see? What patterns do you see with the Illinois districts?
* Pick three other districts you are interested in and collect the same information as you did for the Illinois districts.



Rubric
------------


These are guidelines, but feel free to try new things and stretch your
creativity for a high pass. **In your submission text, please clearly state which set of requirements you are attempting to fulfill.**

Note: Please submit these all on the same document for easier grading. For instance, if you make a table in Excel, you should copy paste it into Word alongside your reflection. PDF submissions are encouraged.



**Pass**
* Format    
    * Written in the form of a research report, including an introduction, description of research and analysis.
    * 350 word minimum

* Research
     * Records data in chart format on average grade level, median income, and race/ethnicity for the City of Chicago, Evanston CCSD, and Kenilworth
     * Selects non-Illinois districts that are similar in one way (for instance, geographic location) but different in another way (for instance, racial makeup)
     * Records data in chart format on average grade level, median income, and race/ethnicity for three other districts
     * Provide outside information to provide at least one other pieces of statistical data on these districts. Be sure to cite your sources.


* Analysis
     * Discusses patterns of race, class, and achievement. Explains what you think could be responsible for these patterns, taking on a sociological mindset that emphasizes differential access to resources. Address diversity within groups as well.
    * Analyzes these for both the Illinois districts and your chosen districts.
    * Contextualizes notable differences between the Illinois districts and your chosen districts
    * Integrates at least two course concepts into this analysis




**High Pass**
* Format    
    * Written in the form of a research report, including an introduction, description of research and analysis.
    * 500 word minimum

* Research
    * Records data in chart format on average grade level, median income, and race/ethnicity for the City of Chicago, Evanston CCSD, and Kenilworth
    * Selects non-Illinois districts that are similar in one way (for instance, geographic location) but different in another way (for instance, racial makeup)
    * Records data in chart format on average grade level, median income, and race/ethnicity for three other districts
    * Provide outside information to provide at least two other pieces of statistical data on these districts. Be sure to cite your sources.



* Analysis
    * Discusses patterns of race, class, and achievement. Explains what you think could be responsible for these patterns, taking on a sociological mindset that emphasizes differential access to resources. Address diversity within groups as well.
    * Analyzes these for both the Illinois districts and your chosen districts.
    * Contextualizes notable differences between the Illinois districts and your chosen districts
    * Integrates at least four course concepts into this analysis
    * Identifies limitations to this method of finding patterns
    * Uses an outside source to hypothesize one potential source of that linkage (for instance, maybe not having as much access to tech is one of the reasons students fall behind? Look it up and cite a reliable source that makes the connection)
