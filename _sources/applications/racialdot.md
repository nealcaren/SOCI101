Racial Dot Map and Segregation
============

As we discussed in this lesson, racial and ethnic segregation is an important aspect of the American landscape. In this exercise, you will examine different patterns of segregation found in metropolitan areas.


To Do
-----

* Visit the Racial Dot Map.
*  Click “Add Map Labels” in the upper left corner. If this doesn't work, try a different browser.
* On the racial dot map, visit Cleveland, Raleigh, Richmond, and Birmingham. For each city, how would you describe the level of Black-White segregation? Which of the four cities would rank the most segregated? The least?
* On the racial dot map, visit Albuquerque, NM and Oxnard, CA. How would you rank the level of Latino-non Latino segregation? How does Latino-White segregation compare to the Black-White segregation you explored in the four above cities?
& Finally, explore more fully one zone from one of these six cities. Your focus could either be the border between two racially different neighborhoods or some sort of surprising racial/ethnic concentration. Go over to Google Maps and locate the place. Use Street View to help get a sense of the neighborhood. Describe what you researched and what you found. Where appropriate, use pictures in your report.
