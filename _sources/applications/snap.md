SNAP Challenge
============

Social safety net programs are one way to combat economic inequality. These programs are frequently controversial. This exercise allows you to examine one of these programs -  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In doing so, you can think through sociological analyses of the causes of and solutions to poverty.


To Do
-----

* Approximately 15% of North Carolina residents receive SNAP benefits. In this assignment, you will assume that you have a SNAP allotment of $121 per month/per person (the North Carolina average) for you and your 10-year old child for a total of $240 a month.
* Based on your $60 per week food budget, take a trip to your local grocery store (either online or in person) to plan a week of meals for yourself and your child. Make certain you allot yourself the amount of food you typically eat. As a reminder, the recommended daily calories for a 10 year old are 1,400-1,800 and an adult  are 1,800-2,600.
