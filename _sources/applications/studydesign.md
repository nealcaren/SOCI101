Study Design
============

This exercise is an opportunity to practice a particular sociological research method. It will provide an opportunity for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of this method, think seriously about research ethics as well as research design. and other sociological research methods.

To Do
-----

-   Read the Yale Daily News article, “[DKE internal review finds no hostile culture](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/03/08/dke-internal-review-finds-no-hostile-culture/)” and the [study report](http://ydn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20180219171837.pdf). Note: This is an article that generally discusses sexual assault.
-   Write a research proposal that evaluates the Yale DKE study and proposes an additional research project.
-   As an additional resource, take a look at the “[Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20Files/Climate%20Survey/Survey%20Instrument.pdf)” survey. This has some ideas for questions. If you are doing a survey, feel free to re-use their questions (although be sure to note this in your assignment).

    * If survey: provide some of your survey question;
    * If interview: interview questions;
    * I experiment: describe the experiment you are going to conduct?
