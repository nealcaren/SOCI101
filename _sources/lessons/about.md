# Introduction

Each lesson page has the most important information you need to know for each week. Each page includes:
* Learning outcomes for the lesson.
* Links to the relevant book chapter and videos.
* Information on the week's film.
* A list of weekly assignment and deadlines.

To avoid confusion, lesson pages for materials beyond the next exam are not available.

Be sure to consult the [course schedule](https://soci101.org/syllabus/schedule.html) to know which lesson we are on!
