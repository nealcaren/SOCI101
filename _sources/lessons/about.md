# Overview

Each lesson page has the most important information you need to know for each week. Each page includes:
* Learning outcomes for the lesson.
* Links to the relevant book chapter and videos.
* Information on the week's film.
* A list of weekly assignment and deadlines.

To avoid confusion, only current lesson pages are available.
