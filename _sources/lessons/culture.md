# Culture

This lesson introduces how sociologists think about culture. Culture is one of the fundamental elements of social life and, thus, an essential topic in sociology. Many of the concepts presented here will come up again in almost every subsequent lesson. Because culture is learned so slowly and incrementally, we are often unaware of how it becomes ingrained in our ways of thinking. Applying the sociological perspective to culture requires us to recognize the strangeness in our own culture. This lesson outlines the basics of studying culture and allows you to test potential relationships between television depictions of families and marriage rates. Although culture is familiar to us, you should be seeing it in a new and different way by the time you finish this lesson.


## Learning Objectives

## Application: Families

This week you have your first application due. Many significant shifts have occurred over the last fifty years in how we think of the family and the experience of living in a household. These include changes in marital and living patterns, marriage and divorce rates, the gendered nature of housework, and labor force participation. There are many theories to explain the factors. In this application, you will focus on the **role of culture in creating new norms about the family.** Alternatively, culture may merely reflect other shifts i\n society. Is television responsible for the deinstitutionalization of the family? In this application, you will classify tv shows from four different decades to examine which changed first: changes in depictions of families on television or changes in families in society.
