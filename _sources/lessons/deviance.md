# Deviance

This lesson introduces the sociology of deviance and crime. In sociology, deviance isn't an insult.  Deviance means being non-normative: different Sociologists pay particular attention to the socially constructed nature of deviance and conformity, emphasizing how definitions of deviance vary across cultures, history, and situations.  This week, we will examine how the different theoretical perspectives approach deviance. Within sociology, crime is a particular type of deviance: It is the violation of a norm that has been codified into law, for which you could be arrested and imprisoned.  A sociological view of crime includes analyzing patterns through the lens of different demographic groups' power in society yields an interpretation of the data that differs from the mainstream understanding. The case study asks you to interpret findings from a study that looks at the relationship between imprisonment and being re-arrested.

## Discuss (Thursday during class):
### Circle of Books

![Image from film](https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p16869165_i_h10_aa.jpg)

> For over 35 years, the gay porn shop, Circus of Books, served as the epicenter for LGBT life and culture in Los Angeles. Unbeknownst to many in the community it served, the store was cultivated and cared for by its owners, Karen and Barry Mason; a straight couple with three children. CIRCUS OF BOOKS is an intimate portrait of the Masons and their journey to become one of the biggest distributors of hardcore gay porn in the United States. Their story unfolds through the lens of their daughter, filmmaker and artist, Rachel Mason. [rt](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books)


We will use the documentary film [Circus of Books](https://www.netflix.com/title/81011569) as an opportunity to explore how deviance is constructed and contested.  We will watch it together during class.
