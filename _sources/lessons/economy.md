# Social class

In this lesson, we will examine the stratification phenomenon that occurs in all human societies, our own included. Despite rhetorical claims about equality of opportunity for all, America is a profoundly hierarchical society, with the benefits and rewards of living here unequally distributed among its people. A sociological perspective on stratification will increase your understanding in several essential ways. First, it will help you recognize inequities in places you may have overlooked, such as your own town, neighborhood, or school. Second, it will help you consider how social divisions and hierarchies of privilege and disadvantage appear across many of our institutions; access to health care, the justice system, employment, and housing are all governed by structures of inequality. Third, it should enable you to identify your place in these social arrangements and see how your position (or your family’s position) in certain hierarchies has shaped your life chances. Finally, a knowledge of stratification may help you play a role in changing systems of inequality.

## Learning Objectives
