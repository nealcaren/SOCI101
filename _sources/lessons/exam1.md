# Midterm Exam

The midterm exam is Tuesday, March 9th.


The exam is open-book and administered on Sakai. You will have 75 minutes to complete the exam, not including ARS accommodations. You can take the exam anytime on Thursday, October 1st but must complete the exam by midnight, October 1st, Chapel Hill time. You may not communicate with anyone about the contents of the exam on October 1st.


There are three
major types of questions. The first set of questions are similar to
those on InQuizitive, so practice there. The lesson key words cover what
I think are the core concepts in each chapter, so these are particularly
important to know. The second type of question is similar to Case
Studies, so be sure to practice and review your approach. There is a
Case Study due this  week, so be sure to complete it before the
exam, so you have that additional opportunity to practice. Finally,
there will be questions that ask you to make connections between the
films and course concepts. They don't require detailed knowledge of each
scene, but be sure to be familiar with the major themes of each film
shown.
