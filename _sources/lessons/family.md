# Families and Relationships


In this lesson, we examine society’s most fundamental social group—the family. Yet what makes a family is subject to debate. Sociology doesn’t define a family by who its members are but by what they do, how they relate to one another, and their relationship to the larger society. You will probably see some of your own family’s story in these discussions. We’ll look at the dynamic diversity of family forms in the contemporary United States, the functions of the family for society, the hierarchies of inequality that shape family life, the work that gets done by and in families, the kinds of troubles families experience, and the political and cultural controversies that affect families. You will learn that when it comes to family life, change is the only constant.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:     
* Describe society's current understanding of family and recognize change in marriage and family patterns.
