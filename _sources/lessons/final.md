# Final Exam

The midterm exam is Friday, November 20th at 4 pm. We will have a review session on Zoom on Tuesday.


The exam is open-book and administered on Sakai. You will have three hours to complete the exam, not including ARS accommodations. You can take the exam during any three-hour period on Friday, November 20th, between the hours of 8 am and 10 pm, Chapel Hill time. You may not communicate with anyone about the contents of the exam on November 20th.


The exam will be similar to the midterm, with questions on core lessons concepts; Case Studies to analyze; and questions that ask you to make connections between the films and course concepts. The exam is cumulative, with approximately one-third of the lesson concept questions from the first half of the semester. The only films included are Strong Island; Knock Down the House; Pushout; and We Are The Radical Monarchs.
