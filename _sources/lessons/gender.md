# Gender

This lesson focuses on the processes involved in constructing the meanings of genders and sexualities and the real consequences of gender and sexual inequality.  Gender and sexuality are often portrayed as part of our biological inheritance, unchanging, and unchangeable. Sociologists see sex, gender, sexual orientation, and trans identities are status categories that structure social inequality and shape individual identities. We all experience their overlap in our everyday lives. A sociological perspective allows us to see the cultural and environmental influences on what may be considered biologically based identities and lets us identify and critique the stratification systems that have resulted from these influences.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand central concepts in the sociology of gender and sexuality and how major sociological perspectives view gender and sexuality.

> Recalling a watershed event in US politics, this Peabody Award-winning documentary takes an in-depth look at the 1972 presidential campaign of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and the first to seek nomination for the highest office in the land. Shunned by the political establishment and the media, this longtime champion of marginalized Americans asked for support from people of color, women, gays, and young people newly empowered to vote at the age of 18. Chisholm's bid for an equal place on the presidential dais generated strong, even racist opposition. Yet her challenge to the status quo and her message about exercising the right to vote struck many as progressive and positive..  [Kanopy](https://unc.kanopy.com/video/crisholm-72)
