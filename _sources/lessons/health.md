# Health

Health and illness are constants of human existence, a natural part of having a physical body that is subject to injury, disease, aging, and death. Health and illness are not just physical statesâ€”they also include aspects of our mental well-being and are influenced by shifting cultural beliefs about what is ideal and desirable. As a society, we have established the social institution of medicine to address the challenges of our physical existence. Sociologists ask you to consider how larger social forces help shape this institution and your own embodied experience of health or illness.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:     
* Understand the difference between the cultural meaning of illness, the social construction of illness, and the social construction of medical knowledge.

* Analzye patterns in educational inequalities.

## Discuss (Thursday during class):
### Cooked: Survival by Zip Code

![Image from film](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/782919115.jpg)

> Cooked: Survival by Zip Code tells the story of the tragic 1995 Chicago heatwave, the most traumatic in U.S. history, in which 739 citizens died over the course of just a single week, most of them poor, elderly, and African American. Cooked is a story about life, death, and the politics of crisis in an American city that asks the question: Was this a one-time tragedy, or an appalling trend?. [Official description](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/videos/cooked-survival-by-zip-code/)


We will use the documentary film [Cooked: Survival by Zip Code](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/videos/cooked-survival-by-zip-code/) as an opportunity to explore the sociology of health.  We will watch it together during class.
* Be sure to have [the movie](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/videos/cooked-survival-by-zip-code/) ready to go at the start of class.
* Login to the course Slack by 9:45am and say hi to your group!
