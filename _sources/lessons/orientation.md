## Discuss: The Derby
![](../images/the_derby.jpg)


> Following the haves and the have-nots during Kentucky Derby weekend via on-location interviews from varied perspectives, The Derby explores unseen sides of Kentuckyâ€™s biggest sporting event. From an anonymous reveler on Millionaires Row, to Guatemalan equine workers supporting their relatives, the film offers a thoughtful yet fun peek beyond the mint juleps and fancy hats and into the heart of the fastest two minutes in sports. [Remington Smith](https://www.theremingtonsmith.com/thederby)

We start applying our sociological tools to film  with the short film [The Derby](https://vimeo.com/333091980). The documentary is available for free on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/333091980). We will watch it together during class.  
* Be sure to have [The Derby](https://vimeo.com/333091980) ready to roll at the start of class.
* Login to the course Slack by 9:45am and say hi to your group! If you can, it might be easier to have your phone on one device and Slack on another.
