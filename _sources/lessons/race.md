# Race and Ethnicity

Central to the sociology is the understanding that race and ethnicity are socially constructed categories. While each is based on traits we may see as biological, such as skin color or facial features, the meanings attached to race and ethnicity are created, maintained, and modified over time through social processes in which we all take part. When a society categorizes people based on their race and ethnicity (and all do), it creates a system of stratification that leads to inequality. Society’s resources—wealth, power, privilege, opportunity—are distributed according to these categories, thereby perpetuating inequalities that are all too familiar here in the United States. In this lesson, you will also come to understand the importance of race and ethnicity in forming individual identity. Our racial and ethnic identities have profound effects on our sense of self, and our bonds to other people may be based on shared identities—or may transcend those categories entirely.

## Discuss (Thursday during class):
### Banished

![Image from film](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/banished/images/film_top.jpg)

> A hundred years ago, in communities across the U.S., white residents forced thousands of black families to flee their homes. Even a century later, these towns remain almost entirely white. BANISHED tells the story of three of these communities and their black descendants, who return to learn their shocking histories. [Official description](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/banished/film.html)


We will use the documentary film [Banished](https://fod-infobase-com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/p_ViewVideo.aspx?xtid=49768) as an opportunity to explore the sociology of race and ethnicity.  We will watch it together during class.
* Be sure to have [the movie](https://fod-infobase-com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/p_ViewVideo.aspx?xtid=49768) ready to go at the start of class.
* Login to the course Slack by 9:45am and say hi to your group!
