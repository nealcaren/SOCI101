# Race and Ethnicity

Central to the sociology is the understanding that race and ethnicity are socially constructed categories. While each is based on traits we may see as biological, such as skin color or facial features, the meanings attached to race and ethnicity are created, maintained, and modified over time through social processes in which we all take part. When a society categorizes people based on their race and ethnicity (and all do), it creates a system of stratification that leads to inequality. Society’s resources—wealth, power, privilege, opportunity—are distributed according to these categories, thereby perpetuating inequalities that are all too familiar here in the United States. In this lesson, you will also come to understand the importance of race and ethnicity in forming individual identity. Our racial and ethnic identities have profound effects on our sense of self, and our bonds to other people may be based on shared identities—or may transcend those categories entirely.

## Discuss (Thursday during class):
### Strong Island

![Image from film](https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p13925270_v_h10_aa.jpg)

> Strong Island chronicles the arc of a family across history, geography and tragedy - from the racial segregation of the Jim Crow South to the promise of New York City; from the presumed safety of middle class suburbs, to the maelstrom of an unexpected, violent death. It is the story of the Ford family: Barbara Dunmore, William Ford and their three children and how their lives were shaped by the enduring shadow of race in America. A deeply intimate and meditative film, Strong Island asks what one can do when the grief of loss is entwined with historical injustice, and how one grapples with the complicity of silence, which can bind a family in an imitation of life, and a nation with a false sense of justice. [Official description](https://www.strongislandfilm.com)


We will use the documentary film [Strong Island](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168230) as an opportunity to explore the sociology of race and ethnicity.  We will watch it together during class.
* Be sure to have [the movie](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168230) ready to go at the start of class.
* Login to the course Slack by 9:45am and say hi to your group!
