## Discuss: The Derby



![](../images/the_derby.jpg)


> Following the haves and the have-nots during Kentucky Derby weekend via on-location interviews from varied perspectives, The Derby explores unseen sides of Kentucky’s biggest sporting event. From an anonymous reveler on Millionaires Row, to Guatemalan equine workers supporting their relatives, the film offers a thoughtful yet fun peek beyond the mint juleps and fancy hats and into the heart of the fastest two minutes in sports. [Remington Smith](https://www.theremingtonsmith.com/thederby)





We start applying our sociological tools to film  with the short film [The Derby](https://vimeo.com/333091980). The documentary is available for free on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/333091980). We will watch it together during class.  
* Be sure to have [The Derby](https://vimeo.com/333091980) ready to roll at the start of class.
* Login to the course Slack by 9:45am and say hi to your group! If you can, it might be easier to have your phone on one device and Slack on another.
