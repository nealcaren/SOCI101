> award-winning filmmakers Stanley Nelson, Marcia Smith, and Noland Walker reveal the true, tragic story behind enigmatic preacher Jim Jones and his promise of a world of economic and racial equality that ultimately led to the largest mass murder-suicide in history. This documentary tells the story of the people who joined Peoples Temple, following Jones from Indiana to California and ultimately to their deaths in Guyana in November 1978. [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/jonestown/)



We will use the documentary film [Jonestown: the life and death of Peoples Temple](http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=https://www.nclive.org/cgi-bin/nclsm?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?customID=53983) as an opportunity to identify and evaluate concepts related to the fundamentals of sociology.  We will watch it together during class.
