# Socialization

In this lesson, you will learn how the self is connected to social phenomena, such as gender, race, and the media, and how interactions construct them all. You will be acquiring some new analytic tools, including the concepts of socialization and impression management. This lesson presents concepts of self from Freud, Mead, and Cooley; impression management and presentation of the self from Goffman; socialization; statuses and roles; and the social construction of emotions. You will be introduced to a new way of looking at the self—indeed, a new way of looking at your self—that emphasizes the role of the social in creating the individual. And you will be reminded of the reverse: as your society makes you who you are, you have a role (in fact, many roles) to play in shaping your society. The Case Study for this week allows you a chance to analzye how behaviors travel through social networks.
