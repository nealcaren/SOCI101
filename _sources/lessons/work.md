# Economy and Work

In this lesson, you will understand why work is a classic topic of sociological inquiry: it is a fulcrum point between the micro and the macro and a link between the individual and the social. You will see the connection between your life's everyday conditions on the job and the broader structural changes related to history, technology, and the economic system you work in. You will become familiar with the classic and more recent sociological studies in this area and how they have shaped our ways of thinking about the social world of economy and work.  In this lesson, we look at issues regarding the economy, focusing specifically on work because the economy shapes the types of work available and our patterns of working.
