Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What do I need to buy?
-----------------------------
The course textbook and access to Netflix.


What's the attendance policy?
-----------------------------

I expected everyone to participate during our virtual meetings actively.
Watching the films together is a central component of this course. If
you are unable to attend, you may write a more extended film response
and submit your film notes for that week's Film Response assignment on
Sakai. Except for the exams, I drop one or more of the lowest grades for
each assignment type.

If you anticipate not being able to participate in class for an extended period of time, please email [Professor Caren](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).

How do I prepare for an exam?
-----------------------------

The exams are multiple-choice and administered on Sakai. There are three
major types of questions. The first set of questions are similar to
those on InQuizitive, so practice there. The lesson key words cover what
I think are the core concepts in each chapter, so these are particularly
important to know. The second type of question is similar to Case
Studies, so be sure to practice and review your approach. There is a
Case Study due each exam week, so be sure to complete it before the
exam, so you have that additional opportunity to practice. Finally,
there will be questions that ask you to make connections between the
films and course concepts. They don't require detailed knowledge of each
scene, but be sure to be familiar with the major themes of each film
shown.

I can't make it to the exam. What can I do?
-------------------------------------------
If  you are unable to take an exam because of a serious medical condition, religious observance, or athletic obligation, contact the [Dean of Students Office](https://odos.unc.edu/student-support/class-absences/request-university-approved-absences) to request a University Approved Absence in advance. If you have a exam day emergency, email [Professor Caren](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).


Why does this class have a {doc}`code-of-conduct`?
------------------------------------------------
I intend that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed
both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to
this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I intend to
present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity:
gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity,
race, and culture. The topics that we're covering in this class are
often difficult, not just intellectually but emotionally. While I expect
there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement in the course of
our class discussions, I ask that you engage in dialogue with care and
empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without
becoming disagreeable. In this course, we will not shy away from the
uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing assumptions and values
is not just one of sociology's tasks but is an activity vital to engaged
citizenship. I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports
your taking these intellectual and emotional risks. The
{doc}`code-of-conduct` helps ensure that everyone is aware of the types of
interactions that foster positive interactions and those that may not.

Can I hand in work late?
------------------------

No, but for each non-exam assignment, you can drop your lowest grade(s).
Skipped assignments receive a zero, but as long as you do at least the
minimum number of required assignments of that type, the zero won't
impact your final grade. If you have a medical condition or other
situation that impacts your ability to do academic work, such as a
concussion or hospitalization, please email the instructor to make
alternate arrangements.

Where can I get extra help with sociological concepts?
------------------------------------------------------

Learning online can be tougher than in a traditional classroom.
**Details to come.**

What other campus resources can help me?
----------------------------------------

The [[Writing Center ](https://writingcenter.unc.edu)is available
to assist with papers. If you experience an emergency this semester,
please contact the[[ Dean of Students
Office]{.ul}](https://odos.unc.edu). They will notify all of your
instructors so that you will not have to. [Student
Wellness](https://studentwellness.unc.edu/) You have paid for
all of these excellent resources. Please use them!

Do academic integrity policies still apply to an online course?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has had a
student-led honor system for over 100 years. Academic integrity is at
the heart of Carolina, and we all are responsible for upholding the
ideals of honor and integrity. The student-led Honor System is
responsible for adjudicating any suspected violations of the Honor Code,
and all suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to
the honor system. Information, including your responsibilities as a
student, is outlined in the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance.
Your full participation and observance of the Honor Code is expected.
All academic work in this course, including homework, quizzes, and
exams, is to be your own work, unless otherwise expressly provided. It
is your responsibility if you have any doubt to confirm whether or not
collaboration is permitted.

How can I get accommodations?
-----------------------------

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the
implementation of reasonable accommodations, including resources and
services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions,
temporary disability, or pregnancy complications resulting in
difficulties with accessing learning opportunities. All accommodations
are coordinated through the Accessibility Resources and Service Office.
If you are registered with ARS, be sure to confirm with me or the TA
that we have received your accommodation request.

How is the final grade determined?
----------------------------------

The final grade is based on the following elements:

|Assignment  | Opportunities  |   Graded  |   % of Course Grade |
|---|---|---|---|
|Applications  |    7         |       5  |       20 |
|Case Studies |      6      |          5    |     15 |
|InQuizitive    |   12     |          10    |    15 |
|Film Responses  |   12     |          10     |   15 |
|Exam 1      |      1       |         1     |    10 |
|Exam 2    |        1       |         1     |    10 |
|Exam 3      |      1     |           1   |      15 |
|              |  |              |           100 |





All grading takes place on Sakai and you can find your current grade in
the Sakai Gradebook.

Do you round up?
----------------

No. Your final letter grade will be converted from your numeric score as
follows:

94% to 100% = A

\- 90% to 93.99% = A-

\- 87% to 89.99% = B+

\- 84% to 86.99% = B

\- 80% to 83.99% = B-

\- 77% to 79.99% = C+

\- 74% to 76.99% = C

\- 70% to 73.99% = C-

\- 67% to 69.99% = D+

\- 64% to 66.99% = D

\- 60% to 63.99% = D-

\- 59.99% or below = F
