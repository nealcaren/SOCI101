# Frequently Asked Questions

## How is the final grade determined?

## Do you round up?
No.

# What's the attendance policy?
I expected everyone to participate during our virtual meetings actively.  Watching the films together is a central component of this course. If you are unable to attend, you may write a more extended film response and submit your film notes for that week's Film Response assignment on Sakai.  Except for the exams, I drop one or more of the lowest grades for each assignment type.

## How do I prepare for an exam?

## What other campus resources can help me?
The Writing Center is available to assist with papers. If you experience an emergency this semester, please contact the Dean of Students Office. They will notify all of your instructors so that you will not have to. You have paid for all of these wonderful resources, please use them!

## Do academic integrity policies still apply to an online course?
Yes. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has had a student-led honor system for over 100 years. Academic integrity is at the heart of Carolina and we all are responsible for upholding the ideals of honor and integrity.  The student-led Honor System is responsible for adjudicating any suspected violations of the Honor Code and all suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the honor system. Information, including your responsibilities as a student, is outlined in the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance. Your full participation and observance of the Honor Code is expected. All academic work in this course, including homework, quizzes, and exams, is to be your own work, unless otherwise specifically provided. It is your responsibility if you have any doubt to confirm whether or not collaboration is permitted.

## How can I get accommodations?
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the implementation of reasonable accommodations, including resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, temporary disability or pregnancy complications resulting in difficulties with accessing learning opportunities. All accommodations are coordinated through the Accessibility Resources and Service Office. If you are registered with ARS, be sure to confirm with me or the TA that we have received your accommodation request.
