7.	Which discussion section you are in is based **on the last two digits of your PID**. Use this table to lookup which section you are in:

| PID Range | Section Letter|
|-----------|---------|
| 00-04     | A       |
| 05-09     | B       |
| 10-14     | C       |
| 15-19     | D       |
| 20-24     | E       |
| 25-29     | F       |
| 30-34     | G       |
| 35-39     | H       |
| 40-44     | I       |
| 45-49     | J       |
| 50-54     | K       |
| 55-59     | L       |
| 60-64     | M       |
| 65-69     | N       |
| 70-74     | O       |
| 75-79     | P       |
| 80-84     | Q       |
| 85-89     | R       |
| 90-94     | S       |
| 95-99     | T       |

8.	Select your section, making sure you were using the last two digits of your PID. For example, if your PID is  730142368, your last two digits are 68 and you would be in section N. On the next page, click the green “Join Channel” button.
