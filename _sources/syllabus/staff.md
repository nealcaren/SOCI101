I am an Associate Professor in the Sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I earned my BA in Sociology from Columbia University and my PhD from New York University. My current research is on contemporary US social movements and the uses of media data for understanding movement processes. I also serve as the editor of the interdisciplinary social movements journal Mobilization. Check out [our most recent issue](https://mobilizationjournal.org/toc/maiq/24/1). In addition to teaching Sociological Persepctive, I also teach a capstone course for our Social and Economic Justice minor. At the graduate level, I teach course computational social science, with a focus on collecting and analyzing text data with Python. I enjoy trail running in [Carolina North](https://facilities.unc.edu/operations/grounds-services/carolina-north-forest/) and [trail racing](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Neal&lname=Caren) in the mountains. Pronouns: he/him.

[Katherine Tait](http://katherinetait.web.unc.edu/) is a PhD candidate in the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of Sociology. She earned her BA in Sociology & Anthropology from Carleton College and her MA in Economics from the New School for Social Research. Her research is on the interrelationship between social movement and economic conditions, and currently focuses on democratic workplaces, specifically worker-owned cooperatives (businesses in which all workers are also co-owners, and have equal input on decisions affecting day-to-day operations and the future direction of their workplace). While at UNC, Katherine has taught courses in Economic Sociology and Introduction to Sociology, has worked on the social science journals Mobilization and Social Forces, and in 2017 founded the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of [SPLC on Campus](https://www.splcenter.org/), an organization for graduate and undergraduate student activism for equal justice and opportunity. Her non-work hobbies include yoga, going to music and dance performances, taking care of her newborn son Vinnie, and, of course, streaming various TV shows in this "Golden Age of Television!" Pronouns: she/her.
