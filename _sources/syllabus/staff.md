I am an Associate Professor in the Sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I earned my BA in Sociology from Columbia University and my PhD from New York University. My current research is on contemporary US social movements and the uses of media data for understanding movement processes. I also serve as the editor of the interdisciplinary social movements journal Mobilization. Check out [our most recent issue](https://mobilizationjournal.org/toc/maiq/24/1). In addition to teaching Sociological Persepctive, I also teach a capstone course for our Social and Economic Justice minor. At the graduate level, I teach course computational social science, with a focus on collecting and analyzing text data with Python. I enjoy trail running in [Carolina North](https://facilities.unc.edu/operations/grounds-services/carolina-north-forest/) and [trail racing](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Neal&lname=Caren) in the mountains.
