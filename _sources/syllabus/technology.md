## Course Website
The [official course website](http://soci101.org) is your primary source of information on the course.
* The *Getting Started* section contains all the information in a traditional syllabus across several pages.
* The course *Lessons* pages have all the details about each week's topic, including the readings, videos and assignments.
* The *Application* pages describe each of these assignments. Other assignment materials are on Sakai.

## Sakai
[Sakai](https://sakai.unc.edu/x/47btQ1) is for grades, exams, and submitting your assignments.
* The *Gradebook* has all your grades for the semester.
* You submit your Applications in the *Assignments* section.
* Case Studies and the Exams are both available in the *Test and Exams* section. Each week's lesson will provide the relevant links.
If you don't have access to the course Sakai site, email [Professor Caren](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).

## Slack
The course [Slack space](http://soci101.slack.com) is for text discussions.
* Each Thursday during class, film discussions will take place in on the Slack space.
* The #questions channel is always available for question on sociological concepts or course assignments.
* Visit the {doc}`Slack 101 page <../syllabus/slack>` for complete directions on how to signup.


## InQuizitive
Each week you are assigned a chapter from the textbook. To help you focus your reading on the central concepts and provide a quick check on your capacity to identify and use the new concepts, you are required to complete a weekly InQuizitive reading test. These quizzes are untimed and you can keep answering questions until you earn a perfect score.

## Zoom
[Tuesday class](https://unc.zoom.us/j/96531859232) and {doc}`Student meetings  <../syllabus/meetings>`  happen on Zoom.
