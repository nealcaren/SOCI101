# Technology

Since the course is online, we will use a couple of pieces of technology this semester.


## Course Website
The [official course website](http://soci101.org) is your primary source of information on the course.
* The *Getting Started* section contains all the information in a traditional syllabus across several pages.
* The course *Lessons* pages have all the details about each week's topic, including the readings, videos and assignments.
* The *Application* pages describe each of these assignments. Other assignment materials are on Sakai.

## Sakai
[Sakai](https://sakai.unc.edu/x/47btQ1) is for grades, exams, and submitting your assignments.
* The *Gradebook* has all your grades for the semester.
* You submit your Applications in the *Assignments* section.
* Case Studies and the Exams are both available in the Test and Exams section. Each week's lesson will provide the relevant links.
If you don't have access to the course sakai site, email [Professor Caren](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).

## Slack
The course [Slack site](http://soci101.slack.com) is for text discussions.
* Each Thursday during class, film discussions will take place in on the Slack site.
* The #ask-the-prof and #ask-anyone channels are always available for question on sociological concepts or course assignments.
* If you did not receive an access link for the Slack site, let [me](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu) know.

## InQuizitive
Each non-exam week you are assigned a chapter from the textbook. To help you focus your reading on the central concepts and provide a quick check on your capacity to identify and use the new concepts, you are required to complete a weekly InQuizitive reading test. These quizzes are untimed and you can keep answering questions until you earn a perfect score.

If you have never used InQuizitive before, I highly recommend that you complete the [How To Use InQuizitive](https://ncia.wwnorton.com/111835) assignment at the beginning of the semester.

## Zoom
{doc}`Student meetings  <../syllabus/meetings>`  happen on Zoom.
