## Objective

As was discussed in the lesson materials, there is a relationship between race, income and educational performance. In this exercise, you will examine different patterns of student achievement.

## Description

Go to the New York Times&#39; interactive site [Money, Race, and Success: How Your School District Compares](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html?mcubz=3).

- Start with the first graph, which gives student achievement and family income data for every school district in the country. What do you notice about the overall patterns? Are there any exceptions?
  - Find and record data on average grade level, median income, and race/ethnicity for the following districts: City of Chicago, Evanston CCSD, and Kenilworth (all in Illinois).
- Look at the second graph, which documents differences in achievement between White, Black, and Latino students.
  - What is it showing you? In particular, what patterns do you observe around race, class, and achievement? What do you think could be responsible for these patterns? What diversity within groups do you see?
- Pick three other districts you are interested in.
  - Find and record their data. What patterns do you see with these?

## Requirements

- Your research report, of at least 250 words, should address each of the questions above.
- No late assignments will be accepted.

## Grading

- Grading is High Pass (100); Pass (87) and Fail (0). Students who do not satisfactorily complete the exercise (i.e, Fail) will be allowed to revise and resubmit their application for a Pass within one week.
- To be eligible for a High Pass, you must go substantially beyond the assignment requirements _both in terms of research and analysis_. To qualify for a High Pass, you must include a section at the front of your paper called &quot;High Pass&quot; with at least 50 words detailing how you exceeded the requirements.
