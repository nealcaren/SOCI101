<p>This website provides all the course materials for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Sociological Perspectives (SOCI101.001) taught by Professor Neal Caren.</p>
<p>For Fall 2020, the course is entirely online. This website is an interactive guide to the course, including the syllabus, lesson plans for each week and assignments.</p>

<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course is designed to introduce students to the sociological study of society. Sociology focuses on the systematic understanding of social interaction, social organization, social institutions, and social change. Major themes in sociological thinking include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the interplay between the individual and society;</p></li>
<li><p>how society is both stable and changing;</p></li>
<li><p>the causes and consequences of social inequality;</p></li>
<li><p>and the social construction of human life.
Understanding sociology helps discover and explain social patterns and see how such patterns change over time and in different settings. By making vivid the social basis of everyday life, sociology also develops critical thinking by revealing the social structures and processes that shape diverse forms of human life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the semester, you will develop and apply your sociological imagination to think systematically about how things we experience as personal problems are social issues. In your textbook readings, you will be introduced to the significant topics that sociologists study and how the topics are analyzed. During class time and through our assignments, you will have a chance to further develop your sociological imagination and apply it to new situations. In exams and exercises, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your mastery of sociological thinking.</p>
<p>This course has no prerequisites and is appropriate for just about everyone. The course is an introduction to the field of sociology for students who plan further study, and an overview for students will only visit the world of sociology once. The course will also provide students an opportunity for students to learn information relevant to the sociology section of the MCAT.</p>
<div class="section" id="course-objectives">
<h3>Course Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#course-objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upon the successful completion of this course students will be able to:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Demonstrate understanding of fundamental sociological theories and concepts;</p></li>
<li><p>Explain, evaluate and apply the process of sociological research;</p></li>
<li><p>Discover and develop a sociological imagination and apply it to societal issues;</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the ways in which social institutions are interdependent; and</p></li>
<li><p>Explore how social factors contribute to social inequalities and efforts to create social change.</p></li>

<span id="id1"></span><h3>Applications<a class="headerlink" href="#applications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>(20% of course grade)</strong><br />
You will have eight opportunities to complete short research and writing assignments that employ concepts from the course to the outside world. You might shop at supermarket, watch a television show, or analyze housing data. For each Application, you will theories and concept from the course to develop expectations about what you’ll find. After collecting the data, you will write up your study in a short research report. You will have eight opportunities to complete these, and your highest five grades will count.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h3>Case Studies<a class="headerlink" href="#case-studies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>(15% of course grade)</strong><br />
Understanding how social science research is used to test theories is a unique skill you will develop in the course. Six times during the semester you will be asked to read a passage and answer a series of questions about how the study was conducted, what was found, and how it is linked to the larger body of sociological literature. These are conducted out of class on Sakai  Your top five grades count.</p>

<span id="id3"></span><h3>InQuizitive<a class="headerlink" href="#inquizitive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>(15% of course grade)</strong><br />
Each non-exam week you are assigned a chapter from the textbook. To help you focus your reading on the central concepts and provide a quick check on your capacity to identify and use the new concepts, you are required to complete a weekly InQuizitive reading test. These quizzes are untimed and you can keep answering questions until you earn a perfect score.</p>
<p>If you have never used InQuizitive before, I highly recommend that you complete the How To Use InQuizitive assignment at the beginning of the semester.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We hope to create an environment where diverse individuals can learn and interact in a positive and affirming way. The Sociology Department is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</p>
<p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive learning environment.
**Be careful in the words that you choose. ** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. Harmful behaviors include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</p></li>
<li><p>Discriminatory jokes and language.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).</p></li>
<li><p>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Unwelcome sexual attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Respect the privacy of others.</strong> In a classroom setting, we expect that the person sitting next to us isn’t secretly videotaping us. The presumption that our words will not be shared beyond the classroom setting is essential to creating an open atmosphere for discussion and learning. We seek to create this same environment online. Do not record or publicly distribute the comments of other students.</p>
<p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and political, happen all the time, and this course will be no exception. We must engage with differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of discussions comes from our diverse community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all of this course’s spaces, including public channels, private channels, emails, and direct messages, both online and off. anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or referred to the Honor Court as violations may “<a class="reference external" href="https://studentconduct.unc.edu/sites/studentconduct.unc.edu/files/documents/Instrument%20of%20Student%20Judicial%20Governance.pdf">impair the right of all members of the University community to learn and thrive in a safe and respectful environment</a>”</p>
<p>Please let me know if something said or done in the classroom, by either myself or other students, is particularly troubling or causes discomfort or offense. While our intention may not be to cause discomfort or offense, the impact of what happens throughout the course is not to be ignored and is something that I consider to be very important and deserving of attention.  I am always open to listening to students’ experiences, and want to work with students to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue. You an reach me over <a class="reference external" href="mailto:neal&#46;caren&#37;&#52;&#48;unc&#46;edu">email</a> or text (919-381-7638). If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the issue directly with me, I encourage you to seek out another, more comfortable avenue to address the issue.</p>

<p>I expected everyone to participate during our virtual meetings actively.  Watching the films together is a central component of this course. If you are unable to attend, you may write a more extended film response and submit your film notes for that week’s Film Response assignment on Sakai.  Except for the exams, I drop one or more of the lowest grades for each assignment type. <strong>Details to come.</strong></p>

<h3>How do I prepare for an exam?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-prepare-for-an-exam" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The exams are multiple-choice and administered on Sakai. There are three major types of questions. The first set of questions are similar to those on InQuizitive, so practice there. The lesson key words cover what I think are the core concepts in each chapter, so these are particularly important to know. The second type of question is similar to Case Studies, so be sure to practice and review your approach. There is a Case Study do each exam week, so be sure to complete it before the exam, so you have that additional opportunity to practice. Finally, there will be questions that ask you to make connections between the films and course concepts. They don’t require detailed knowledge of each scene, but be sure to be familiar with the major themes of each film shown.</p>

<p>I intend that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I intend to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. The topics that we’re covering in this class are often difficult, not just intellectually but emotionally. While I expect there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement in the course of our class discussions, I ask that you engage in dialogue with care and empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. In this course, we will not shy away from the uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing assumptions and values is not just one of sociology’s tasks but is an activity vital to engaged citizenship. I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports your taking these intellectual and emotional risks. The <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-syllabus/code-of-conduct"><span class="doc">Code of Conduct</span></a> helps ensure that everyone is aware of the types of interactions that foster positive interactions and those that may not.</p>

<p>No, but for each non-exam assignment, you can drop your lowest grade(s). Skipped assignments receive a zero, but as long as you do at least the minimum number of required assignments of that type, the zero won’t impact your final grade. If you have a medical condition or other situation that impacts your ability to do academic work, such as a concussion or hospitalization, please email the instructor to make alternate arrangements.</p>

<h3>Do academic integrity policies still apply to an online course?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-academic-integrity-policies-still-apply-to-an-online-course" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has had a student-led honor system for over 100 years. Academic integrity is at the heart of Carolina, and we all are responsible for upholding the ideals of honor and integrity.  The student-led Honor System is responsible for adjudicating any suspected violations of the Honor Code, and all suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the honor system. Information, including your responsibilities as a student, is outlined in the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance. Your full participation and observance of the Honor Code is expected. All academic work in this course, including homework, quizzes, and exams, is to be your own work, unless otherwise expressly provided. It is your responsibility if you have any doubt to confirm whether or not collaboration is permitted.</p>

<h2>Culture<a class="headerlink" href="#culture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This lesson introduces how sociologists think about culture. Culture is one of the fundamental elements of social life and, thus, an essential topic in sociology. Many of the concepts presented here will come up again in almost every subsequent lesson. Because culture is learned so slowly and incrementally, we are often unaware of how it becomes ingrained in our ways of thinking. Applying the sociological perspective to culture requires us to recognize the strangeness in our own culture. This lesson outlines the basics of studying culture and allows you to test potential relationships between television depictions of families and marriage rates. Although culture is familiar to us, you should be seeing it in a new and different way by the time you finish this lesson.</p>

<h2>Socialization<a class="headerlink" href="#socialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this lesson, you will learn how the self is connected to social phenomena, such as gender, race, and the media, and how interactions construct them all. You will be acquiring some new analytic tools, including the concepts of socialization and impression management. This lesson presents concepts of self from Freud, Mead, and Cooley; impression management and presentation of the self from Goffman; socialization; statuses and roles; and the social construction of emotions. You will be introduced to a new way of looking at the self—indeed, a new way of looking at your self—that emphasizes the role of the social in creating the individual. And you will be reminded of the reverse: as your society makes you who you are, you have a role (in fact, many roles) to play in shaping your society. The Case Study for this week allows you a chance to analzye how behaviors travel through social networks.</p>

<h2>Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This lesson explores some of the different ways we organize our lives in groups. Here you will gain some of the analytic tools you can use to understand the specific groups we’ll be investigating later in the semester. Concepts such as peer pressure, teamwork, bureaucratization, and anomie can be fruitfully applied to analyses of families, work and volunteer organizations, political groups, and religious communities. Consider this lesson an introduction to group dynamics in general—a springboard from which to begin our sociological analysis of particular types of groups. During the week, think about the groups you belong to and how they affect your values and behavior.</p>

<h2>Deviance<a class="headerlink" href="#deviance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This lesson introduces the sociology of deviance and crime. In sociology, deviance isn’t an insult.  Deviance means being non-normative: different Sociologists pay particular attention to the socially constructed nature of deviance and conformity, emphasizing how definitions of deviance vary across cultures, history, and situations.  This week, we will examine how the different theoretical perspectives approach deviance. Within sociology, crime is a particular type of deviance: It is the violation of a norm that has been codified into law, for which you could be arrested and imprisoned.  A sociological view of crime includes analyzing patterns through the lens of different demographic groups’ power in society yields an interpretation of the data that differs from the mainstream understanding. The case study asks you to interpret findings from a study that looks at the relationship between imprisonment and being re-arrested.</p>

<p><img alt="People doing various things" src="_images/REALWORLD7_FIG03_CO.jpg" /></p>
<p>Social interaction represents one of the key building blocks of society. Despite being unscripted, these interactions have strict unwritten rules. Breaking those rules, or being deviant, is a critical way of discovering what the norms are and what are the range of reactions to norm violations.</p>
<div class="section" id="description">
<h3>Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You will conduct an exercise that violates social norms and write a short paper about the experience. This exercise may be performed alone or in a group (of your choice) of four or fewer participants. The norm violation can not include illegal activities or those that might risk someone’s safety, health or well-being. In our current pandemic world, I would strongly encourage you to conduct your breach on social media, such as something defies our new norms of online courses, such as brushing your teeth during Zoom class. If conducting your experiment as a group, each group member will perform the breach once. When not performing the breach, the other group members should observe the interaction and write an observation log documenting people’s reaction to the breach.</p>
<p>Write a brief research report that discusses your research and what you found. The report should include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A description of the norm you violated. (Remember, you cannot break a law).</p></li>
<li><p>A description of the violation.</p></li>
<li><p>A description of the most general way people responded as the violation was enacted.</p></li>
<li><p>A description of how you felt enacting the norm violation.</p></li>
<li><p>An analytic discussion of the sociological significance of the breach.</p></li>
<li><p>Video or photographic proof that the breach occurred. Ideally, this would be a link to a video of the breach. If you are doing this solo, a photo of the situation pre or post breach is sufficient. If you have trouble submitting the video/picture, you can text it to me (919-381-7638) along with your name. As part of your assignment, put “I texted the video to Professor Caren from my phone, 919-xxx-xxxx.”</p></li>

<p>Many significant shifts have occurred over the last fifty years in how we think of the family and the experience of living in a household. These include changes in marital and living patterns, marriage and divorce rates, the gendered nature of housework, and labor force participation. There are many theories to explain the factors. In this application, you will focus on the potential role of culture in creating new norms about the family. Alternatively, culture may merely reflect other shifts i\n society. Is television responsible for the deinstitutionalization of the family? In this application, you will classify tv shows from four different decades to examine which changed first: changes in depictions of families on television or changes in families in society.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You will explore two hypotheses on the relationship between popular culture and the deinstitutionalization of the family. The first is provided below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> TV shows began increasingly focusing on non-conjugal families prior to shifts in the larger society.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong> : Develop a second hypothesis. This could be related to any other aspect of changes in the family that happened over the last fifty years and whether or not it is reflected on television. Make sure to link this to a specific concept from the book and include your citation.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Our cultural data comes from TV shows. Randomly sample one year from every other decade (ie. the 1950s, 1970s, 1990s, 2010s). Find a listing of the 20 most popular TV shows those years.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1950s- 1990s: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/">Classic TV Hits</a></p></li>
<li><p>2000s  on: Wikipedia (for example, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-rated_United_States_television_programs_of_2006%E2%80%9307">Top-rated United States television programs of 2006–07</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculate the percentage of shows for a year that were “household” centered (e.g. “Friends” or “The Simpsons”) as opposed to focused on the workplace (e.g. “The Office” or “CSI”) or something else. <strong>Overall, would you say that television has become more or less household focused?</strong> If so, when did the shift happen?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Focus now on <strong>only</strong> the household shows. Come up with a coding scheme that will allow you to test your hypotheses. For example, you might want to look for presence or absence of marriage; whether or not a central character is divorced or widowed; whether adult children live in the home; or whether the couple is interracial.</p></li>
<li><p>Record data for all your TV shows! You do not need to watch them. Wikipedia and other internet sources are your friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Aggregate your results. Does the evidence support either of the hypotheses?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a brief research report that discusses your research and what you found. The report should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an introduction;</p></li>
<li><p>a discussion of your hypotheses;</p></li>
<li><p>a description of your data and methods of analysis;</p></li>
<li><p>a description of what you found with respect to a shift in becoming more or less household focused and your two hypotheses. Include a table with your write up of your findings.</p></li>
<li><p>An evaluation of what you learned about the media you studied. Did the findings surprise you?</p></li>

<p>Social safety net programs are one way to combat economic inequality. These programs are frequently controversial. This exercise allows you to examine one of these programs - the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In doing so you can think through sociological analyses of the causes of and solutions to poverty.</p>

<li><p>Approximately 15% of North Carolina residents receive SNAP benefits. In this assignment you will assume that you have a SNAP allotment of $121 per month/per person (the North Carolina average) for you and your 10-year old child for a total of $240 a month..</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your <em>$60 per week food budget,</em> take a trip to your local grocery store (either online or in person) to plan a week of meals for yourself and your child.

<li><p>On the racial dot map, visit Albuquerque, NM and Oxnard, CA. How would you rank the level of Latino-non Latino segregation? How do Latino-White segregation compare to the Black-White segregation you explored in the four above cities?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, explore more fully one zone from one of these six cities. Your focus could either be the border between two racially different neighborhoods or some sort of surprising racial/ethnic concentration. Go over to Google Maps and locate the place.
