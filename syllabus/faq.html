<p>The course has one textbook, <a class="reference external" href="https://sakai.unc.edu/access/basiclti/site/876ae89d-6d5e-440c-91df-74d000c3611f/ca4add80-bbd5-4174-9bcb-679e12b7e7ed">The Real World: An Introduction to Sociology, 7th Edition</a>, by Kerry Ferris and Jill Stein. You can purchase it through the bookstore. Our class is using Digital Delivery for the textbook.  You already have access to the ebook, and in order to keep it, all you have to do is follow the instructions in the email from digitaldelivery&#64;unc.edu, to opt in by purchasing the “opt in” item listed for your class on our website, store.unc.edu. I strongly recommend this option, which costs $39.95 and includes additional online resources we will use. (If you aquire a print version of the textbook, you will also need to purchase access to the extra online resources we will be using each week.)</p>
<p>The 6th edition of the textbook is very similar, so feel to use that if you can find it. However, you will still need to purchase access to the “InQuizitive for The Real World” for the 7th edition from the student store.</p>
<p>You will also need access to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a> during the semester. We will be watching twelve documentaries during the semester. Several films are available through the UNC library, but their collection of contemporary movies is more limited, so many of our films are available over Netflix. A standard Netflix account is $13 a month, but you get your first month free.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-s-the-attendance-policy">
<h2>What’s the attendance policy?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-attendance-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I expected everyone to  participate actively during our virtual meetings.
Watching the films together is a central component of this course. If
you are unable to attend, you may write a more extended film response
and submit your film notes for that week’s Film Response assignment on
Sakai. Except for the exams, I drop one or more of the lowest grades for
each assignment type.</p>
<p>If you anticipate not being able to participate in class for an extended period of time, please email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:neal&#46;caren&#37;&#52;&#48;unc&#46;edu">Professor Caren</a>.</p>

<p>The core idea and concepts of the course are in the lectures, readings and videos posted with each lesson.   On Tuesdays, we will meet on Zoom. I’ll be reviewing the homework, explaining the central concepts for the lesson, and detailing future assignments. A recording will be made available on the lesson page for those of you who cannot join us.</p>
<p>Thursday we meet on <a class="reference external" href="http://soci101.slack.com">Slack</a>. Each week we will be watching a different film together. We will meet in our course <a class="reference external" href="http://soci101.slack.com">Slack</a> channel. After a few minutes of introductions, everyone will press play and start their stream of the film. During the film, groups will discuss connections between the film and course concepts. If the film runs long, feel free to stick around or you can finish the movie at a later point.</p>

<p>Teaching assistants are graduate students in the sociology department whose job is to help you out in this course. Primarily, they are responsible for grading your work, but they are each quite knowledgeable about the course content. If you have any questions about your assignment grades or course content, feel free to reach out to a TA. Each TA is responsible for a portion of the class, based on your last name.</p>

<p>The exams are multiple-choice and administered on Sakai. There are three
major types of questions. The first set of questions are similar to
those on InQuizitive, so practice there. The lesson key words cover what
I think are the core concepts in each chapter, so these are particularly
important to know. The second type of question is similar to Case
Studies, so be sure to practice and review your approach.  Finally,
there will be questions that ask you to make connections between the
films and course concepts. They don’t require detailed knowledge of each
scene, but be sure to be familiar with the major themes of each film
shown. Practice exams will be made available on Sakai.</p>

<p>I intend that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed
both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to
this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I intend to
present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity:
gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity,
race, and culture. The topics that we’re covering in this class are
often difficult, not just intellectually but emotionally. While I expect
there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement in the course of
our class discussions, I ask that you engage in dialogue with care and
empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without
becoming disagreeable. In this course, we will not shy away from the
uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing assumptions and values
is not just one of sociology’s tasks but is an activity vital to engaged
citizenship. I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports
your taking these intellectual and emotional risks. The
<a class="reference internal" href="code-of-conduct.html"><span class="doc">Code of Conduct</span></a> helps ensure that everyone is aware of the types of
interactions that foster positive interactions and those that may not.</p>
<p>Any student who is impacted by discrimination, harassment, interpersonal (relationship) violence, sexual violence, sexual exploitation, or stalking is encouraged to seek resources on campus or in the community. Please contact the Director of Title IX Compliance Adrienne Allison (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:Adrienne&#46;allison&#37;&#52;&#48;unc&#46;edu">mailto:Adrienne<span>&#46;</span>allison<span>&#64;</span>unc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>), Report and Response Coordinators in the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office (&lt;reportandresponse&#64;unc.edu), Counseling and Psychological Services (confidential), or the Gender Violence Services Coordinators (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:gvsc&#37;&#52;&#48;unc&#46;edu">mailto:gvsc<span>&#64;</span>unc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>; confidential) to discuss your specific needs.

<p>For each non-exam assignment, you can drop your lowest grade(s).
Skipped assignments receive a zero, but as long as you do at least the
minimum number of required assignments of that type, the zero won’t
impact your final grade.</p>
<p>You can hand in Applications and Film Reflections up to two weeks late for reduced credit. Late applications must fulfill the requirements for a Pass, but will receive a Low Pass score and will not have the opportunity to revise the assignment. Late Film Reflections must complete the expanded requirements of those who did not participate in film discussions and will receive an 85 for satisfactorily completing the assignment.</p>

<h2>Do academic integrity policies still apply to an online course?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-academic-integrity-policies-still-apply-to-an-online-course" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes. I expect all students to follow the guidelines of the UNC honor code. In particular, students are expected to refrain from “lying, cheating, or stealing” in the academic context. You can read more about the honor code at <a class="reference external" href="https://studentconduct.unc.edu">honor.unc.edu</a>. In any course, including mine, what constitutes cheating can change from one activity to another. For example, collaboration may be encouraged for an assignment but qualify as cheating during an exam. Please see my guidelines for each activity, and if you are unsure, please ask me to clarify.</p>
<p>In remote classes, there may be many temptations for using online exchange sites, such as Chegg. Note that these sites provide names of students who have used their materials, and they routinely cooperate with institutions around academic integrity issues. Additionally, the Sakai website tracks your location and submission times. Simultaneously handing in nearly-identical answers raises flags. Please don’t get caught up with honor code issues just because it appears to be simple and untraceable. It is not!</p>
